# Project status — read this first

One page to orient anyone joining this repo: what it is, what is verified, what is simulated,
what is blocked, and where the detail lives.

Last verified: **2026-10-25**. Everything below was executed, not asserted.

> **Whole-project view:** this file describes Person B's experience workspace. Person A's contracts and intelligence modules live on the public `main` branch and are **not merged** here. The visual atlas covers both halves and the integration gap: [PROJECT-ATLAS.html](PROJECT-ATLAS.html) · [PDF](PROJECT-ATLAS.pdf) · [PROJECT-MAP.md](PROJECT-MAP.md).

## 1. What this is

**AegisDAO IntentLock** — a decision-integrity console for DAO treasury proposals.

A proposal passes a vote; the queued transaction does something else. The demo proposal
**AIP-042** authorises 250,000 USDC across two transfers and a bounded allowance. The queued
transaction is an `upgradeTo(maliciousImpl)` on the treasury proxy. The reference executor
rejects it with `SelectorNotAuthorized`.

The thesis: **voting transparency is not informed consent.** A voter can read the forum post, the
delegate tally and the timelock, and still have no idea which bytes will execute. This repo makes
the gap between "what the proposal said" and "what the transaction does" the primary artifact.

**Stack:** Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, Tailwind v4, viem 2, zod 4, Vitest 5.
Runs fully offline — no chain, no network, no live model.

## 2. Verified state

| Check | Command | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tests | `npm test` | **57 passing** in 9 files |
| Scorecard | `npm run scorecard` | **25 PASS · 0 FAIL · 9 TEST_REQUIRED** (34 entries) |
| Types | `npm run typecheck` | clean |
| Lint | `npm run lint` | clean |
| Build | `npm run build` | **passes** — 21 pages, all 11 `/arena/*` prerendered |
| Demo consistency | `npm run demo:check` | 11/11 scenarios match expected |
| Arena CLI | `npm run arena -- 3` | prints `REJECTED SelectorNotAuthorized` step by step |
| Routes | `npm run dev` | 7 app routes + `/present` + 11 reports, all 200 |

Headline numbers, computed live (nothing is hardcoded in the UI):

| Stage | Score | Status | Meaning |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :--- |
| Claims | 0.81 | GREEN | 6 retained claims, 2 ambiguities resolved, `c6` rejected |
| COI | 0.88 | RED | 4 links; noisy-OR above the 0.65 threshold |
| Voting | 0.71 | AMBER | 59% informed weight; one 90,000-weight FOR voter overlaps a flagged wallet |
| Execution | — | RED | `SelectorNotAuthorized` — hard gate, no score |

Arena: **1 PASSED · 8 REJECTED · 2 FLAGGED** across 11 scenarios.

## 3. The honesty ledger

The single most important table. Do not upgrade a row without changing the code that earns it.

| Area | Status | What that means |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Evidence hashing + Merkle proofs | **Real** | `keccak256(UTF-8)` leaves, sorted-pair tree, proofs verify in the browser. Documents are authored seeds. |
| Extraction validator | **Real** | Zod + source-quote hydration; a claim without a matching span is rejected. |
| Intent / content / commitment hashing | **Real code** | Byte parity with Solidity is **not** proven (P1). |
| Calldata decoder + error mapping | **Real** | ERC-20, proxy, Ownable, recursive multicall. Unknown selectors are flagged, never hidden. |
| Reference executor | **Real model, not EVM** | Rule, commitment, version, timelock, value, re-entrancy and post-condition checks. Executes nothing. |
| Violation report | **Real, deterministic** | Assembled from the run result, never from prose. |
| Wallet graph math | **Real** | Direct-transfer, common-funder, time-correlation; disclosure damping; noisy-OR. |
| Voting / claims / COI scoring | **Real code over fixtures** | Formulas run; inputs are fixtures. |
| AI extraction | **Pre-baked** | `intent.extracted.json` / `claims.json` are fixtures. No model is called. |
| Wallet graph data | **Simulated** | Addresses, amounts, timestamps, tx hashes labelled `SIMULATED DATA`. |
| Queued tx + tx hashes | **Simulated** | Derived deterministically from scenario id, calldata, block. Nothing broadcast. |
| Disclosure challenge | **Simulated status, real payload** | Flag requires the graph to reach the red threshold; the payload and digest are computed. |
| Sentinel trace | **Fixture** | Verdict is derived by walking the trace for `DELEGATECALL`. Not a fork trace. |
| Solidity executor, governor, registries | **Pending Person A** | Nine properties `TEST_REQUIRED`, amber, never green. |

## 4. Positioning and prior art

Read this before describing the project to anyone technical.

**What is already solved.** OpenZeppelin and Compound governors derive the proposal id from the
encoded calldata (`hashProposal(targets, values, calldatas, descriptionHash)`), so the vote already
binds to the exact bytes. Do not claim that as novel — it has been standard since 2020, and in the
Tornado Cash takeover the malicious calldata *was* in the proposal.

**What is not solved.** Nobody could read those bytes, nothing required the description to match
them, and the code at an approved address can change after approval. That is the gap.

| System | Already does | Leaves open |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Compound / OZ Governor | Vote = hash of calldata | Description is a separate string |
| Tally | Decodes and simulates proposals | Advisory; the governor never consults it |
| Tenderly, OZ Defender | Fork simulation | Catches reverts, not intent mismatch |
| Zodiac Roles Modifier | Enforces calldata-level permissions at execution | Standing **policy**, not a per-proposal **commitment** |
| Forta | Runtime monitoring | After the fact |

**The problem is peer-reviewed.** *Understanding Security Issues in the DAO Governance Process*,
IEEE TSE 2025 (SUSTech / PolyU / ZJU), asks exactly "does the proposal ensure consistency between
descriptions and code?" Across 3,348 DAOs and 65,436 proposals, **32,500 — over 90% of those
examined — were inconsistent.** The authors built detection; nobody in that line built enforcement.

**The claim that survives scrutiny:**

> Vote-to-calldata binding is solved. What is not solved is that over 90% of proposals describe
> something different from what they execute, and that the evidence and conflicts behind them live
> in a forum post nothing verifies. We bind the evidence, the disclosures and the compiled rules
> into the same commitment the vote signs, and the executor refuses anything that does not match.

## 5. What is done vs what is blocked

### Done — Person B (this workspace)

- Hashing, Merkle evidence, validator, decoder, reference executor, report, graph, scoring.
- Seven routes, arena runner, scorecard, fixtures and regeneration scripts.
- Judge Mode (guided seven-stop bar), `/present` seven-slide deck, and self-contained HTML/JSON report downloads.
- Verdicts for the sentinel and disclosure layers are **derived from evidence**, not from the
  scenario's layer label. Both scorecard rows fail if that derivation is removed.
- Docs: this file, `README.md`, `docs/demo-script.md`, `docs/person-a-handoff.md`,
  `docs/audit-2026-10-25.md`.

### Blocked — Person A (no Solidity in this repo)

Nine deliverables, all specified in `docs/person-a-handoff.md` §1:

1. Contracts: `ProposalRegistry`, `DisclosureRegistry`, `IntentGovernor`, `IntentLockExecutor`,
   `ActionDecoder` + mocks.
2. ABIs and `deployments/local.json` — replaces derived addresses.
3. Error selector parity with `ERROR_DEFINITIONS`.
4. Solidity hash vectors for six keys → closes **P1**.
5. Real evidence fixtures per scenario.
6. Hardhat scorecard → closes **P2–P9**.
7. Real `callTracer` traces for scenarios 3, 4, 6 → closes **P8**.
8. `npm run arena` bridge to a live deployment.
9. Deployed executor adapter behind the existing `RunResult` shape.

**The nine amber properties:** Solidity hash parity · append-only registry · commitment
immutability · real EVM re-entrancy · EIP-1967 post-condition · timelock + executed flag ·
guardian halt · real Sentinel trace · on-chain disclosure verification.

## 6. Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000
npm test               # 57 tests
npm run demo:check     # read-only consistency check, writes nothing
npm run build          # production build
```

Fixture regeneration (`scorecard`, `evidence:build`, `vectors`, `errors`) **overwrites fixtures**.
Run them intentionally, then re-run `npm test`.

---

## 7. Environment gotchas (each cost real time)

- **`vitest` needs a writable TEMP.** In this sandbox it dies with `EPERM` on `%TEMP%` unless you
  redirect: `TMPDIR=./.tmp TEMP=./.tmp TMP=./.tmp npx vitest run`.
- **`next build` hangs forever on a stale `.next/lock`.** Symptom: silence, then "Another next
  build process is already running." Kill the orphaned `next build` PID, `rm -f .next/lock`,
  rebuild — it then compiles in ~2s. `next dev` uses `.next/dev` and does not conflict.
- **`curl` localhost needs `--noproxy '*'`** — the sandbox exports a loopback HTTP proxy.
- **`gh` needs `APPDATA` and `USERPROFILE` exported** or it reports being logged out.
- **graft** is installed for repo navigation: `graft map .`, `graft ask "…" .`,
  `graft callers <symbol> .`. Always pass `--json`; there is no quiet flag.

## 9. The one-line summary

The decision trail, the evidence binding, the conflict detection and the enforcement logic are
real code over labelled fixtures. The on-chain guarantee is a specification, not a fact — and the
scorecard says so in amber, on purpose.
